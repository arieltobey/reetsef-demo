The following reports are a practical demonstration of key performance indicators defined in a report by Queensland University of Technology (QUT): 'Healthcare Sector: Renewable Energy and Enabling Technology and Services Framework (REETSEF) as part of the wider[ iHUB Smart Buildings Data Clearing House Project](https://www.ihub.org.au/dhc9-dch-at-scale-on-boarding-proof-of-concept-at-a-qld-hospital-site/).

The concepts presented may be used to report on the impact of a technology tested in a healthcare living laboratory. For context on the efficacy of KPIs used and their application, see the QUT report [here](https://ihub.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LLHC1_Healthcare_Sector_REETSEF_V3.pdf).

The reports were created in Microsoft Power BI Desktop. This program is required as a prerequisite to open the files using the following process:

1. Download the specific KPI report file (.pbix)
2. Open the file (must have Microsoft Power BI installed)

The source files from a sample data set are also supplied to enable users to understand how the data is structured to produce the reports. A user can manipulate the data within a KPI report by:

1. Downloading the appropriate data file (.csv file with the same name as the one in the fields tab to the right of the Power BI Desktop screen)
2. Changing the data source to the downloaded data file, instructions [here](https://community.powerbi.com/t5/Desktop/How-to-replace-Data-Source-for-existing-report/m-p/58947#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20without%20going,data%20sources%20and%20chnage%20source.&text=go%20into%20Edit%20Queries.,Source)%20and%20change%20it%20there.).
